# Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. **FrenchAmericanGames Decrypter (FAGDec):** [Download here](https://github.com/CelesteBlue-dev/PSVita-RE-tools/raw/master/FAGDec/build/FAGDec.vpk).
2. **Server Address:** The custom server address you want to use.
3. **LittleBigPlanet Patcher:** [Download here](http://bit.ly/patchvita).

## Step 1: Decrypt the Game with FAGDec
Follow the detailed guide on decrypting your game using FAGDec: [FAGDec Guide](https://littlebigpatcherteam.github.io/2025/03/14/FAGDec-guide.html).

## Step 2: Install LittleBigPlanet Patcher
1. Download the LittleBigPlanet Patcher from [this link](http://bit.ly/patchvita).
2. Install the `.vpk` file on your PS Vita.

## Step 3: Set the Server Address
1. Open the LittleBigPatcher app on your PS Vita.
2. Navigate to **Edit URLs**.
    - If the server URL you want to use is not listed, add it manually.
3. Return to the main menu.
4. Navigate to **Select URL**.
    - Choose the server URL you want to use.
5. Return to the main menu.

## Step 4: Patch the Game
1. Open the LittleBigPatcher app.
2. Navigate to **Patch Games**.
3. Select the patching options you prefer.
4. Use the **Browse Games for Title ID** option to locate your LittleBigPlanet game.
    - **Note:** If your game is not listed, repeat Step 1. Ensure you follow these instructions carefully:
      - Do **not** press **START DECRYPT (ELF)**, as this option is currently broken and will not work.
      - Instead, press down once to select **[START] START DECRYPT (SELF)**.
5. Navigate to **Patch! (LittleBigPlanet Main Series)** and confirm by selecting **Yes**.
6. Wait for the patching process to complete.

You are now ready to play LittleBigPlanet with your custom server!

## [Lua](https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.7.tar.gz)

In no way am i saying i made lua lol, please refer to [lua](https://www.lua.org/license.html) but i did delete some unused files from the tar.gz to save space, and had to rename 2 functions named `main` to `luac_main` and `lua_main`
